# ðŸŽƒ Jack-O & The Lanterns ðŸŽµ
Jack-O &amp; The Lanterns; a spooky-fun animatronic singing pumpkin trio synchronized to perform the iconic Ghostbusters theme song! Jack-O, the lead pumpkin, handles the majority of the vocals, while the Lanterns (two backup pumpkins) join in during the chorus with the unforgettable "Ghostbusters!" line.

## Features
- **Jack-O (Lead Pumpkin):** Takes center stage and sings most of the lyrics
- **The Lanterns (Backup Pumpkins):** Chime in during the chorus, synchronizing their movements for the "Ghostbusters!" phrase
- **Synchronized Performance:** The pumpkins' mouths move in sync with the song using precise servo control

## Project Overview
- **Pumpkin Trio:** This project features three pumpkinsâ€”Jack-O as the lead and two backup Lanterns, all performing in sync with each other
- **Audio & Animatronics:** The Ghostbusters theme song is played via speakers, while the pumpkins' mouths move in time with the lyrics
