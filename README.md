Welcome to Jack-O &amp; The Lanterns, a spooky-fun animatronic singing pumpkin trio synchronized to perform the iconic Ghostbusters theme song! Jack-O, the lead pumpkin, handles the majority of the vocals, while the Lanterns (two backup pumpkins) join in during the chorus with the unforgettable "Ghostbusters!" line.
